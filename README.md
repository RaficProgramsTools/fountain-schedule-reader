# Water Feature Schedule - User Guide

This tool allows you to generate daily water feature schedules from an exported XML file and compare them with general monthly prayer times.

## How to Use the Schedule Generator

1.  **Open the Tool**: Double-click `schedule.html` to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).
2.  **Load Schedule File**:
    *   Click the **"Choose File"** (or "Browse") button next to `1. Load Schedule`.
    *   Select your `TimePlaner.xml` (or equivalent export file).
3.  **Configure View**:
    *   **Select Month**: Use the date picker to choose the specific month and year you want to view.
    *   **Filter Days**: Uncheck any days of the week you do not want to see (e.g., if you only want to print the Friday schedule).
4.  **Generate**: Click the **"Show Schedule"** button. The daily schedule for your selected filters will appear below.

## How to Use the Prayer Times Feature

This feature allows you to view general prayer times for reference alongside your schedule.

1.  **Enable Feature**: Check the box labeled **"View Monthly General Prayer Times"**.
2.  **Select Month**: A set of buttons for each month (January - December) will appear. Click on a month to view its data.
3.  **Viewing the Data**:
    *   **Desktop**: The prayer times table appears as a **floating sidebar** on the right side of the screen. It stays visible as you scroll through the main schedule, making it easy to compare times.
    *   **Mobile**: The table appears as a standard list below the controls.
4.  **Hide Feature**: Uncheck the box to hide the prayer times sidebar.

## Printing

This tool is optimized for printing.
1.  Generate your desired schedule.
2.  Press `Ctrl + P` (Windows) or `Cmd + P` (Mac).
3.  The print preview will automatically **hide the controls, buttons, and the prayer times sidebar**, printing only the clean daily schedule list.
